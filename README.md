Rails is magical already, and this package preloads the default Rails 4 setup with plenty of goodies. 

# Getting Started

1. Add the following to your .env file: 
    
    PORT=3000
    RACK_ENV=development

2. Run `foreman start` and add the line, similar to the line below, to `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

    config.secret_key = 'd2b22...'
    
3. Create your heroku app, and push.
